# regnaio/location

If you're looking to use Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) to proxy to multiple paths on an origin service, I hope the information below can help you:

---

## Discussion

GitHub Issues:
- [Proxy to a different path on the origin service #563](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/563)
- [use paths instead of sub domain #286](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/286)

## Diff

[GitHub diff between `main` and my changes (`regnaio/location`)](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/compare/master...regnaio:regnaio/location)

Click on the "Files changed" tab to view all changes

This file is named `1.md` so that it appears first under "Files changed" in the link above

The only **necessary** changes for this feature enhancement are in the files:
- `config/configuration.go`
  - Added `Location` field to `UnvalidatedIngressRule`
- `ingress/ingress.go`
- `ingress/rule.go`
- `proxy/proxy.go`

**Unecessary** changes just for my personal use:
- `Dockerfile`
  - Exposing port 2000 for the metrics server is unecessary

## Limitations without this feature enhancement

Consider the [Ingress rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/local/local-management/ingress/) below:

```yaml
ingress:
- hostname: tunnel.domain.com
  path: ^/api/.*
  service: https://localhost:3000
```

`tunnel.domain.com/api/users/bob` -> `https://localhost:3000/api/users/bob`

Note how the service needs to serve all resources needed by this ingress rule behind the common prefix path `/api/`. You could accomodate this when building your own services, but you may not have control over this in 3rd-party and especially closed-source services

Many services serve resources starting behind the path `/`. Assume that you want multiple of these services behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. Without this feature enhancement, you need a unique hostname (i.e. DNS record) for each service:

**3 DNS records**
```yaml
ingress:
  - hostname: subdomain1.domain.com
    service: https://localhost:3001
  - hostname: subdomain2.domain.com
    service: https://localhost:3002
  - hostname: subdomain3.domain.com
    service: https://localhost:3003
  # etc...
```

The number of DNS records scaling linearly with the number of services is not ideal. What if we could do something like this instead?

**1 DNS record**
```yaml
ingress:
  - hostname: subdomain.domain.com
    path: ^/subdir1/.*
    service: https://localhost:3001
    location: /
  - hostname: subdomain.domain.com
    path: ^/subdir2/.*
    service: https://localhost:3002
    location: /
  - hostname: subdomain.domain.com
    path: ^/subdir3/.*
    service: https://localhost:3003
    location: /
  # etc...
```

In this case, we have a single DNS record, and we can forward to specific services using `path` names we can define arbitrarily. This feature enhancement allows us to do this

## How to use this feature enhancement

[`brenner-tobias` recommended adding another field](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/563#issuecomment-1031702260) to [Ingress rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/local/local-management/ingress/) called `location`

```yaml
ingress:
- hostname: tunnel.domain.com
  path: ^/api/.*
  service: https://localhost:3000
  location: /
```

`tunnel.domain.com/api/users/bob` -> `https://localhost:3000/users/bob`

Intuitively, this new behavior **"slices off"** the first subdirectory of the input `/api/users/bob`, which is `/api`, leaving `/users/bob`, which is requested from the service `https://localhost:3000`

For `location`'s with subdirectories, refer to **Example scenario 1** and **Example scenario 4** below

> **IMPORTANT**: This branch `regnaio/location` and all of its changes can be summarized by:
>
> **The first subdirectory of `path` is replaced by everything in `location`**

If this new behavior doesn't entirely suit your needs, you can always modify the behavior to suit your needs in `proxy/proxy.go`. See the diff above, and feel free to modify the changes I made to `func (p *Proxy) ProxyHTTP`

## Build

After making the necessary code changes from the diff above (or you can just directly use this branch `regnaio/location`), we need to rebuild `cloudflared`

There may be 2 kinds of build outputs that you're interested in:
- a `cloudflared` executable that you can directly run locally
- `cloudflared` packaged in a Docker image for both local and cloud (e.g. k8s) use

Choose whichever of the build processes below depending on your needs:

### 1. Build `cloudflared` executable

This uses `dev.Dockerfile`

Even though we're just building the `cloudflared` executable and not its Docker image, we still use Docker to standardize the build process across different platforms, e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux

```shell
# Navigate to this repo's directory
cd cloudflared/

# Build development Docker image
docker build -f dev.Dockerfile -t cloudflared-dev .

# Run the Docker image with the cloudflared repo mounted as a volume
docker run -it --rm --name cloudflared-dev-container -v ${PWD}:/go/src/github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/ cloudflared-dev

# Remove existing cloudflared executable
rm cloudflared

# Build cloudflared executable
make cloudflared
```

The output executable is named `cloudflared` in the repo directory

### 2. Build `cloudflared` Docker image

This uses `Dockerfile`

```shell
# Navigate to this repo's directory
cd cloudflared/

# Build Docker image
docker build . -t cloudflared:<VERSION>

# Push the Docker image to a registry of your choice so you can pull it into your cloud or other local environment
docker tag cloudflared:<VERSION> <REGISTRY_URL>/cloudflared:<VERSION>
docker push <REGISTRY_URL>/cloudflared:<VERSION>
```

## Thoughts before merging

1. How will `location` and the changes to `func (p *Proxy) ProxyHTTP` affect other protocols besides http(s):// (e.g. ws(s)://, tcp://, ssh://, rdp://, unix:/)?

2. The new behavior "**The first subdirectory of `path` is replaced by everything in `location`**" (see **IMPORTANT** note above) is opinionated, though not necessarily bad. Are there better ways to generalize this? Consider the following example scenarios and the results with the current implementation of this feature enhancement:

### **Example scenario 1: Location with subdirectory**

```yaml
ingress:
- hostname: tunnel.domain.com
  path: ^/api/.*
  service: https://localhost:3000
  location: /serviceapi
```

`tunnel.domain.com/api/users/bob` -> `https://localhost:3000/serviceapi/users/bob`

### **Example scenario 2: Path with multiple subdirectories**

```yaml
ingress:
- hostname: tunnel.domain.com
  path: ^/api/subdir/.*
  service: https://localhost:3000
  location: /
```

`tunnel.domain.com/api/subdir/users/bob` -> `https://localhost:3000/subdir/users/bob`

### **Example scenario 3: Path with multiple subdirectories and location with subdirectory**

```yaml
ingress:
- hostname: tunnel.domain.com
  path: ^/api/subdir/.*
  service: https://localhost:3000
  location: /serviceapi
```

`tunnel.domain.com/api/subdir/users/bob` -> `https://localhost:3000/serviceapi/subdir/users/bob`

### **Example scenario 4: Path with multiple subdirectories and location with multiple subdirectories**

```yaml
ingress:
- hostname: tunnel.domain.com
  path: ^/api/subdir/.*
  service: https://localhost:3000
  location: /serviceapi/servicesubdir
```

`tunnel.domain.com/api/subdir/users/bob` -> `https://localhost:3000/serviceapi/servicesubdir/subdir/users/bob`
